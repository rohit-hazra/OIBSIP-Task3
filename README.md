## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure
- **CSS3** – Modern layouts, gradients, responsive grid
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Logic, DOM manipulation, state management
- **Browser Local Storage** – Data persistence

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Tasks are stored as JavaScript objects.

2. All tasks are saved in **browser localStorage**, so data remains after page refresh.

3. Tasks are automatically separated into:

    - ⏳ Pending Tasks
    - ✅ Completed Tasks

4. UI updates dynamically whenever a task is added, edited, completed, or deleted.

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Uses **CSS Grid** for layout flexibility
- Automatically stacks sections on smaller screens
- Sticky header keeps task statistics always visible
